    title: "Mastering CSS Grid Layout in Modern Web Development",
    excerpt:
      "CSS Grid is one of the most powerful layout systems available in CSS today. It allows developers to create complex, responsive layouts with minimal code. By understanding the difference between grid-template and grid-auto properties, you can precisely control both explicit and implicit grid tracks. This flexibility makes Grid ideal for dashboards, galleries, and data-heavy applications where alignment matters.",

    title: "When to Choose Flexbox Instead of CSS Grid",
    excerpt:
      "Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts where content flows in a single row or column. It excels at distributing space between items and aligning them dynamically. In contrast, Grid shines for two-dimensional layouts that require control over both rows and columns simultaneously. Understanding the strengths of each system helps developers build cleaner, more maintainable UIs without overcomplicating the CSS.",

    title: "Building an Accessible Search Component with React and ARIA",
    excerpt:
      "Accessibility should be a first-class concern when building search experiences. This means providing clear labels, keyboard navigation support, and meaningful feedback for users of assistive technologies. ARIA roles such as 'searchbox' and 'listbox' can greatly enhance the experience, while semantic HTML ensures broad compatibility. Combining accessibility best practices with React hooks allows developers to create fast, inclusive, and user-friendly search interfaces.",
